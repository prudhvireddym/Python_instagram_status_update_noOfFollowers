## Python_Selenium Instagram auto followers to status

###### In this project i created a selenium bot that automatically check for my followers every few seconds and if it finds my followers have changed it automatically updates my followers count to my bio along with a random joke. Since any website hates constant requests, inspite of using three diffent ways to access my followers count the bot may not work after some time so in order to avoid that you have to give a high intervel like 20 or 30 minutes between each request.

### Below is a working video for the code above
